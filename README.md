# HR-Analytics

An attractive and eye-catching HR dashboard using Power BI. We will begin this project by importing data & creating an employee demographics page that gives us the overall demographic outlook of the organization. We will then create pie charts and doughnut charts to visualize gender & racial diversity. In the final tasks, we will create an employee detail page that will provide you with all the important information about any employee with just a click. We will also explore buttons, themes, slicers & filters to make the dashboard more interactive & useful.
